All of my systems are fronend and backend. I keep my experiences as organized as possible. Ive only posted some of my more complex systems or ones that i had no idea how to make when i started them.
All of these systems were made in under 2 days each. I also have experience coding UI's but i chose not to showcase that here.

Every system listed here was made 100% by me.
