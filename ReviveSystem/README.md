This is the core of my revive system. On player death they fall to the ground and you have 15 seconds to hold e on them to revive.
The players respawns are manual so the character doesnt disappear on death. When revived you respawn where you died.
The ProximityPromptScript is a local script. I turned off the prompt for the dead player and its only active for alive players.
