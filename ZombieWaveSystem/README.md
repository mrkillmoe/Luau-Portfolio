This system uses places designated for zombie spawns and randomly chooses CFrames on the platforms to spawn them. It also uses a table to track the number of zombies alive.
Once the number hits 0 it fires to a player gui and Changes the wave number + 1. Then the next wave spawns. The number of zombies increase per wave.
