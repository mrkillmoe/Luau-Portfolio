This module script adds players in a table and only starts the countdown time if there are enough players. Minplayers is currently set to 1 for testing purposes. But it does work as intended for multiple players.
Once min players is met and held a countdown for 5 seconds starts and updates a player UI. Then it teleports them to a randomly selected map.
